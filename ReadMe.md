Welcome to *libpruw1* library project,

- a [one wire (W1)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1-Wire) driver for AM335x micro processors,
- designed for [Beaglebone hardware](http://www.beaglebone.org), providing
- configuration of any GPIO as W1 bus (without additional hardware), for
- sending digital output and receiving digital input from the bus,
- logging the bus data line state for monitoring purposes,
- supporting parasite power mode.

*libpruw1* software runs on the host (ARM) and in parallel on a
Programmable Realtime Unit SubSystem (= PRUSS or just PRU) for accurate
bus timing.

The driver provides functions to

- scan the bus for all device IDs,
- send a single byte or a block of eight bytes to the bus,
- receive a single byte or a block of bytes from the bus,
- calculate the CRC checksum for a block of data, and
- compute the temperature in Â°C (centigrade) from Dallas sensors (types `&h10`, `&h20`, `&h22`, `&h28`, `&h3B` or `&h42`).

The *libpruw1* project is [hosted at GitHub](https://github.com/DTJF/libpruw1). It's
developed and tested on a Beaglebone Black under Debian Image
2014-08-05. It should run on all Beaglebone platforms with Debian based
LINUX operating system. It's compiled by the [FreeBasic
compiler](http://www.freebasic.net). A wrapper for C programming
language is included.
