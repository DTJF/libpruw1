Welcome to *@PROJ_NAME@* library,

- a one wire (W1) driver for ARM335x micro processors,
- designed for [Beaglebone hardware](http://www.beaglebone.org), providing
- configuration of any GPIO as W1 bus, for
- sending digital output and receiving digital input from the bus, and
- logging the bus data line state for debug purposes, but
- does not support parasite power mode.

*@PROJ_NAME@* software runs on the host (ARM) and in parallel on a
Programmable Realtime Unit SubSystem (= PRUSS or just PRU) for accurate
bus timing.

The driver provides functions to

- scan the bus for all devices
- send a single byte or a block of bytes to the bus
- receive a single byte or a block of bytes from the bus
- calculate the CRC checksum for a block of data
- compute the temperature from Dallas sensors series 10 and 20.

The *@PROJ_NAME@* project is [hosted at GitHub](@PROJ_WEBS@). It's
developed and tested on a Beaglebone Black under Debian Image
2014-08-05. It should run on all Beaglebone platforms with Debian based
LINUX operating system. It's compiled by the [FreeBasic
compiler](http://www.freebasic.net). A wrapper for C programming
language is included.
