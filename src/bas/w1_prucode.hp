\brief This file synchronizes parameters between FreeBASIC, C and PASM source code.

This file is used in FreeBASIC, C and PASM source code to synchonize
the PRU message code numbers and the debug switch.

Since all the syntaxes have different markers for comments, we cannot
use 'normal' comments here. We've to enclose the comment text in
preprocessor blocks that never get parsed.

\note We cannot use hexadecimal numbers here since syntaxes are different.

\def __PRUW1_DEBUG__
\brief The switch to enable debugging features.

\def CMD_TRIP
\brief The command to initiate a tripple.
\def CMD_RESET
\brief The command to initiate a bus reset.
\def CMD_RECV
\brief The command to initiate a bus receive operation.
\def CMD_SEND
\brief The command to initiate a bus send operation.

Swap the following two lines in order to compile with debugging features.
#define __PRUW1_DEBUG__

#define CMD_RESET 16
#define CMD_TRIP  32
#define CMD_RECV  48
#define CMD_SEND  64
