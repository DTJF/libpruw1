\brief This file synchronizes parameters between FreeBASIC, C and PASM source code.

This file is used in FreeBASIC, C and PASM source code to synchonize
the PRU message code numbers and the monitoring switch.

Since all the syntaxes have different markers for comments, we cannot
use 'normal' comments here. We've to enclose the comment text in
preprocessor blocks that never get parsed.

\note We cannot use hexadecimal numbers here since syntaxes are different.
